Studies of scat of moose, caribou and wolves in the area showed that caribou accounted for only 10 percent of the animals consumed by wolves. Eighty percent of the wolves' diet was deer, with moose making up the remainder. Wolves' preference for deer, the researchers conclude, draws them away from the areas where caribou thrive."

As farfetched as that question at first may seem, both Canadian and American scientists say the concern is warranted, for though it would produce virtually pollution-free energy, the environmental costs of harnessing the Fundy tides of more than 50 feet may be too high. Most of those costs, due to the effects of a Fundy dam on tides in the Gulf of Maine, would be borne not by Canada, but by the United States, and would range from the flooding of valuable New England beachfront property to damage to coastal anadromous fish stocks, especially the herrings, most especially the American shad. While fishermen in the Northeast are just looking forward to the spring shad-spawning runs in the Delaware, Hudson, and Connecticut Rivers, in southern rivers the shad season has been under way since mid-February. In the St. John's in Florida, the Altemaha in Georgia, Albemarle Sound to Virginia's Rappahannock and Potomac, the traditional shad fisheries are commercial fisheries. There, gill nets take the large silver-sided herrings; most of the fish is sold for its roe."

The two sides agreed to name a joint committee of experts. They will review a long-proposed land reclamation and irrigation project for which ground has been broken in North Dakota. The project for the diversion of the Garrison River has passionate adherents in North Dakota and equally passionate opponents in Canada. It is but one of several dozen environmental issues that straddle the remarkably open and porous frontier between the United States and Canada that stretches 3,987 miles from New Brunswick to Vancouver, plus the 1,538 miles separating Alaska from the Yukon and Northwest Territories. It is the longest unfortified border in the world. Enormous amounts of people, ideas, goods, money, fads, energy, water, animals and pollution shuttle back and forth with little bureaucratic interference. But precisely because the two countries and cultures are so integrated, events on one side of the border are likely to set off ripples or shock waves on the other. As in the case of the Manitoba- North Dakota controversy, the debate over acid rain or the unsuccessful attempts to obtain fishing treaties covering Atlantic and Pacific species, these issues often require arduous and time-consuming adjustments of clashing sovereign interests."

By stomach-churning tugs, they are being hoisted to their jobs on the world's largest drilling rig, the 15,000-ton Ocean Ranger. The cargo boat that carried them 14 hours through a stormy night dances below them like an abandoned toy. The mist-shrouded rig, nicknamed the Ocean Danger, looms over them. Its derrick stands as tall as a 35-story building over the water, 14,400 horsepower of machinery pounds relentlessly and 81 crew members scurry about a surface area bigger than two football fields. ''The massiveness kind of terrifies you at first,'' William Aitkenhead, the Ranger's captain, noted later. That is indisputable.

George, said that with the new project, the company expects to generate a 15 percent return on investment at an oil price of $60 a barrel. The expansion will also allow Suncor to use an underground steam heating process rather than open-pit mining for about half of its tar sands oil production, which will reduce the effect on the environment."

The eight movies shown in Canadian Front 2007, the Museum of Modern Art's fourth annual survey of recent Canadian films, are as moody as the climate north of the border. It's unlikely that any American movie star making a directorial debut would choose a woman suffering from Alzheimer's as the subject of a first feature film. But that is the theme of ''Away From Her,'' the Canadian actress Sarah Polley's adaptation of Alice Munro's story ''The Bear Came Over the Mountain.'' The biggest shock in the movie, which Ms. Polley wrote as well as directed, is to discover Julie Christie, radiant at 65 (above with Gordon Pinsent), playing a woman who voluntarily hospitalizes herself after suffering an alarming memory lapse. When her husband of 44 years ( Mr. Pinsent) goes to visit her after an enforced 30-day moratorium on communication, he finds that she barely remembers him. Steeped in sorrow, the movie is a meticulous, beautifully acted exploration of loss of identity, the desperate struggle to communicate over the barrier of Alzheimer's and the fears and doubts raised by the loss of communication. Also of special note is ''Radiant City,'' Gary Burns and Jim Brown's quasi-documentary study of contemporary suburbia, whose environment is described by one expert as ''brutal, depressing and spiritually degrading.'' This film with a satirical edge interweaves portraits of two families who are neighbors in the same sterile development with scenes of a local production of a show called ''Suburb: The Musical.'' The film brings the angst of Richard Yates's novel ''Revolutionary Road'' into the 21st century. (Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, 212-708-9400, moma.org; $10.) STEPHEN HOLDEN"

For some, life is meaningful only when one is flirting with death. This is, Mr. Fraser suggests, an ideal breeding ground for a serial killer. The view in his play, ""Unidentified Human Remains and the True Nature of Love"" (at the Orpheum Theater), is cynical in the extreme -- a pitch black vision of people falling off the edge. With its pungent dialogue and highly graphic sexuality, the play repeatedly arrests the audience's attention, but the cynicism wears thin and the plot is porous. This study of sex and violence is not, as intended, a thriller. Instead of being mysterious, it telegraphs its twists, and at moments it approaches sentimentality."

In South America and Mexico, smoke is still savored, but in Canada, opponents of smoking are pushing hard to clear the air. What follows are reports on where in the world people smoke, and where they don't. Toronto, Vancouver and other Canadian cities are gradually moving to make it virtually impossible to smoke in indoor public places.

Small wonder that it looms as a major issue in impending free-trade negotiations between the two nations. Canada proposed broad talks last year to protect itself against the rising tide of protectionism in Congress, which must respond before a date for the bilateral talks can be set. But the American paper industry, pinched by import competition and slow growth, complains that Canada both charges higher tariffs and unfairly subsidizes its paper industry, partly through interest-free loans for expansion and modernization. The issue thus typifies American complaints in industries ranging from steel to raspberries."

Canadian environmentalists said they were disappointed by the report, drawn up by Mr. Davis and President Reagan's special representative on acid rain, Drew Lewis, because while it admitted that airborne pollutants were a serious problem for both countries, it proposed no targets, timetable or concrete measures for curtailing the pollutants. Mr. Davis, a former Premier of Ontario, said in answer to questions at a news conference here that he would have liked a tougher report, one that called for specific targets to reduce sulfur emissions and control acid rain. Acid rain, a pollution caused by sulfur dioxide from power plants and smelters, and by nitrogen oxide from industrial sources and motor vehicles, is carried long distances in fog, snow and dust, as well as rain.

Kinsella, author of ''Shoeless Joe,'' a novel about an Iowa farmer who builds a baseball stadium in his cornfield in order to bring back to life Shoeless Joe Jackson, one of the ''Black Sox'' stars accused of having thrown the 1919 World Series. Mr. Kinsella, a Canadian who teaches English at the University of Calgary, is the first foreign author to win the award. His novel developed from his short story, ''Shoeless Joe Jackson Comes to Iowa,'' which appeared in the collection ''Aurora: New Canadian Writers 1979.'' After reading a two-line review of Mr. Kinsella's story in Publishers Weekly, Larry Kessenich, a Houghton Mifflin editorial assistant, wrote the author to ask whether it would be possible to develop the story into a novel. Mr. Kinsella, the author of four short-story collections published in Canada, replied that he had never written anything longer than 25 pages. But he agreed to try, and when the manuscript for the novel finally appeared, Mr. Kessenich was so bowled over by it that he told his boss, Robie Macauley, Houghton senior editor, that he thought it was worthy of a fellowship, which is given to unknown or comparatively unknown authors for books that are considered distinguished. Mr. Macauley agreed, and after all 13 Houghton Mifflin editors in Boston and New York concurred, Mr. Kinsella was given a $2,500 grant, plus a $7,500 advance against royalties."

Mr. Reagan fully endorsed a joint Canadian-United States report calling for curbs on airborne pollutants in the second day of an annual meeting with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada. The report, prepared by Mr. Reagan's special envoy for acid raid, Drew Lewis, and William Davis of Canada, as a result of a meeting of the two chiefs of government in Quebec a year ago, was made public in January. Mr. Mulroney endorsed it almost immediately. Five-Year Program Sought It recommended that the United States carry out a five-year program to cost $5 billion, with half the money coming from private industry, to find ways to control airborne emissions of sulphur and nitrogen oxides, which are generated mostly by industrial coal-fired furnaces. These emissions are chemically changed and return to earth as acidic rain, snow or particles. A scientific consensus says these are considered responsible for damage to freshwater lakes and streams. They may also damage trees and plant life and human health."

To plumb it, the Mobil Oil Corporation and its partners must contend with lashing winds, 100-foot waves and ice chunks of a magnitude that sank the Titanic a few miles away. That sort of task is expensive -these days, maybe too expensive. The Mobil group must raise $5 billion to produce oil from the alley that will sell for half the price of five years ago. And now there is a real question as to whether it is worth proceeding. That question is being raised about countless high-cost energy megaprojects throughout this oil-rich country. In the last 10 years Canada has spent billions to recover hard-to-get-at oil, gambling that crude prices would keep going up. But now the dramatic price slides engineered by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries have turned the economics of Canadian oil development on its ear. Oil companies here are looking askance at projects that once seemed destined for financial greatness, and may drop some if oil prices do not pick up."
