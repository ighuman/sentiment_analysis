He said that a report to be issued soon on 1979 oil industry profits would justify the agency."

"{u'main': u""HNG WRITE-OFF SET ON PERU OIL ASSETS CHICAGO, Dec. 30 - HNG/Internorth Inc. said today that it expected to take a large write-off because of the nationalization of its Belco Petroleum operations in Peru.   The Belco unit was seized last Saturday after the company and the Peruvian Government failed to reach an agreement on exploration spending and a tax rate. Another threatened company, Occidental Petroleum, worked out a new contract with Peru, agreeing to expand exploration in return for additional acreage.   On Aug. 29, just after its contract with Peru expired, Belco is said to have cut its production to about 20,000 barrels a day from 30,000 barrels.   Although Belco's operations in Peru have a book value of $400 million, industry analysts said the parent corporation was expected to take a substantially smaller charge.   ''They're going to take a loss of somewhere between $100 million and $200 million,'' said David N. Fleischer, a vice president with Prudential-Bache Securities. Mr. Fleischer and other analysts based their estimates on the company's liabilities after taxes, the expectation of a settlement with the Peruvian Government and proceeds from insurance.   HNG/Internorth, which is based in Omaha, has assets of $10.5 billion, and it earned $165.2 million for the first nine months of 1985 on revenues of $8.02 billion. In the first quarter, HNG earned $113.8 million on $2.90 billion in revenues, of which the Belco unit contributed $19.9 million in earnings, deriving about 24 percent of that from its Peruvian operations. HNG did not report Belco's earnings separately in the second and third quarters.   Both the Standard & Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investment Service affirmed Internorth's ratings today. S.&P. said that its ratings covered $1.9 billion of debt and that the company's senior debt holds a BBB rating. Moody's pointed out that although the exact financial effect of Peru's move was uncertain, some compensation from the Latin American nation was expected.   Separately, HNG/InterNorth said it was withdrawing a proposed offering of 9 3/4 percent notes due in 1992. It said the takeover of Belco's Peruvian operations made it impractical to close the offering today as scheduled.   Belco, which has energy operations in the United States and Canada, is reportedly discussing new exploration with the Governments of Ecuador, Indonesia and Australia.""}",,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/31/business/hng-write-off-set-peru-oil-assets-chicago-dec-30-hng-internorth-said-today-that.html,

Energy Minister Jean Chretien told reporters Monday that a scheduled price increase of $4 a barrel on July 1, which would apply to more than three-quarters of the oil produced in Canada, would not take place. That increase was mandated by a formula reached by Ottawa and the province of Alberta on Sept.1, 1981. However, another feature of that agreement limited oil prices to 75 percent of the world oil price. Currently, the price for ''old'' oil - discovered before Dec. 31, 1980 - is about 73 percent of the free market price for the previous quarter, the period used to make the calculation. A $4 increase would have pushed the price to about 84 percent of the world level."

That sort of task is expensive -these days, maybe too expensive. The Mobil group must raise $5 billion to produce oil from the alley that will sell for half the price of five years ago. And now there is a real question as to whether it is worth proceeding. That question is being raised about countless high-cost energy megaprojects throughout this oil-rich country. In the last 10 years Canada has spent billions to recover hard-to-get-at oil, gambling that crude prices would keep going up. But now the dramatic price slides engineered by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries have turned the economics of Canadian oil development on its ear. Oil companies here are looking askance at projects that once seemed destined for financial greatness, and may drop some if oil prices do not pick up."

Amoco Canada said the exchange with Calgary-based Encor Inc. and Maligne Resources, a subsidiary of the Dow Chemical Company, was the largest one-time property swap in the history of the petroluem industry. No money will change hands, because each of the companies is putting up properties that are about equal in value. The intent is to give each company a larger working interest in lands in which it already has a stake, an Amoco spokesman, David Annesley, said. ""In some lands where we had partnerships with Encor and Maligne, we now effectively have eliminated those partners and taken on sole interest."" The property exchange is part of Amoco Canada's move to form a new public company, Crestar Energy, by combining a portion of its petroleum assets with Canandian assets held by Dow Chemical.

By stomach-churning tugs, they are being hoisted to their jobs on the world's largest drilling rig, the 15,000-ton Ocean Ranger. The cargo boat that carried them 14 hours through a stormy night dances below them like an abandoned toy. The mist-shrouded rig, nicknamed the Ocean Danger, looms over them. Its derrick stands as tall as a 35-story building over the water, 14,400 horsepower of machinery pounds relentlessly and 81 crew members scurry about a surface area bigger than two football fields. ''The massiveness kind of terrifies you at first,'' William Aitkenhead, the Ranger's captain, noted later. That is indisputable.

Compared to the United States, Canada's bad news is worse; inflation is nearly double the American rate, unemployment is one-fifth higher and interest rates are steeper. Explanations are many. It is common wisdom that interest rates must be higher in Canada than in the United States if investment is not to flow southward. Canadian labor costs are comparatively high and as a supplier of resources, Canada is vulnerable to global economic downturns. Then there is the argument, pressed by the Reagan Administration, that Canada has shot itself in the financial foot by imposing nationalistic measures. Critics - including Gulf Oil, which last week cited the plan as a principal culprit in laying off 300 workers - have suggested that the two-year-old National Energy Program has added to inflation, stimulated interest rates and helped bankrupt small oil companies and their suppliers."

The Kearl Oil Sands project, a joint venture between Imperial, which is almost 70 percent owned by Exxon Mobil, and Exxon Mobil Canada, would produce 100,000 barrels of raw bitumen, the tar that emerges from processed oil sands ore, within five years if approved. According to the filings, that figure would eventually increase to 300,000 barrels a day. At the moment, Imperial's plans do not include an upgrader to turn the bitumen into oil. The project must be approved by the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board as well as the province's ministry of the environment. The mine would be built near the Northeastern Alberta community of Fort McMurray."
