The accident in Pickering, Ontario, never threatened public safety, but it forced a costly shutdown of the power plant and increased criticism of the Government's interest in exporting the reactors to sustain Canada's nuclear industry, which has 35,000 workers. ''The most likely casualty from the accident will be the Government's efforts to export these reactors,'' said Norman Rubin, a spokesman for Energy Probe, a Toronto-based citizens action group that monitors and comments on Government energy policies and programs. The group contends that in its zeal to sell the reactors, the Government has been concentrating on developing countries that are unlikely or unable to apply full safeguards. In general, the group would like the Government to follow the lead of major private companies in the United States that are phasing out reactor construction while stressing projects in nuclear waste conversion and disposal."

A murmuring current propelled the raft downstream off Calumet Island, at a point some 60 miles west of Ottawa. Blue herons waded in the wide river. The sun shone brightly. The Wanton Willy was the only boat in sight and the greatest danger at that point had come from the mosquitoes and the black flies that had been left behind when the river widened. MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN is chief of the Ottawa bureau of The Times.Then, after the raft had been moving for about an hour, propelled by the lazy strokes of the dilettante adventurers, the point of the life jackets and helmets was suddenly made clear: first by the roar of water and then by the sight of a turbulent cascade. The craft was pulled up to shore and the passengers who had paid to spend the day running the Rocher Fendu Rapids walked along a narrow path to inspect the first of five flumes through which they and the raft would try to navigate in a four-and-a-half-hour trip downriver."

The decision came out of a case started by the Haida Indians after the province of British Columbia transferred a logging license covering about 25 percent of the Queen Charlotte Islands to the Weyerhaeuser Company of Federal Way, Wash. Those islands and the water surrounding them have been the focus of a century-old ownership claim by the Haida. Much of Canada's resource activity, like Weyerhaeuser's logging, takes place on land owned by provinces. In its unanimous decision, the court said that only governments, not users like Weyerhaeuser, must consult aboriginal groups. While it did not spell out the nature of those consultations, the court turned down a similar appeal yesterday by another native group in British Columbia opposed to the reopening of a mining road. In that case the court found that making the native group part of an environmental review was enough. Ian Austen (NYT)"

But does it really? The problem was that my daughter Hannah and I literally had only 24 little hours. She had traveled to eastern Ontario for a medical school interview, where I had accompanied her; now she was flying back to the west coast to finish her exams. In between there was a window of opportunity called Ste. Anne's, a country inn and spa in the rolling hills of Northumberland County, an hour and a quarter east of Toronto. Hoping that country air, a full range of spa services, three fine meals and a night in a four-poster bed would reinvigorate us for the fray, we turned off Highway 401 at Grafton and headed north. Ste. Anne's itself is no stranger to reinvigoration, having had several identities without entirely shedding the earlier selves. As a result, the place is full of mixed messages, none unpleasant and some decidedly piquant. The first is the look of the building itself, like an Ontario farmhouse that tried to grow up and become a castle. At the center sits a plain-Jane front-gabled house with stone walls almost two feet thick, built in 1857 by a farmer named Samuel Massey; flanking it are the wings, bays, turrets, arches and other fieldstone fantasies concocted by a Texas oil baron and baroness who bought the farm in 1939."

With the exception of a few rivers, this year's Atlantic salmon angling in Canada has ranged from fair to terrible. A prolonged drought and low water in the species' spawning streams are partly to blame. Low water also kept salmon milling about in or near the mouths of those rivers, where in some instances they were illegally overharvested by commercial netters. In the Province of New Brunswick, such a situation triggered a public meeting of the New Brunswick Council of the Atlantic Salmon Federation (A.S.F.). The resulting outcry over the salmon's plight generated a great deal of attention in Canada's press."

As farfetched as that question at first may seem, both Canadian and American scientists say the concern is warranted, for though it would produce virtually pollution-free energy, the environmental costs of harnessing the Fundy tides of more than 50 feet may be too high. Most of those costs, due to the effects of a Fundy dam on tides in the Gulf of Maine, would be borne not by Canada, but by the United States, and would range from the flooding of valuable New England beachfront property to damage to coastal anadromous fish stocks, especially the herrings, most especially the American shad. While fishermen in the Northeast are just looking forward to the spring shad-spawning runs in the Delaware, Hudson, and Connecticut Rivers, in southern rivers the shad season has been under way since mid-February. In the St. John's in Florida, the Altemaha in Georgia, Albemarle Sound to Virginia's Rappahannock and Potomac, the traditional shad fisheries are commercial fisheries. There, gill nets take the large silver-sided herrings; most of the fish is sold for its roe."
