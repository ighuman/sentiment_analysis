The eight movies shown in Canadian Front 2007, the Museum of Modern Art's fourth annual survey of recent Canadian films, are as moody as the climate north of the border. It's unlikely that any American movie star making a directorial debut would choose a woman suffering from Alzheimer's as the subject of a first feature film. But that is the theme of ''Away From Her,'' the Canadian actress Sarah Polley's adaptation of Alice Munro's story ''The Bear Came Over the Mountain.'' The biggest shock in the movie, which Ms. Polley wrote as well as directed, is to discover Julie Christie, radiant at 65 (above with Gordon Pinsent), playing a woman who voluntarily hospitalizes herself after suffering an alarming memory lapse. When her husband of 44 years ( Mr. Pinsent) goes to visit her after an enforced 30-day moratorium on communication, he finds that she barely remembers him. Steeped in sorrow, the movie is a meticulous, beautifully acted exploration of loss of identity, the desperate struggle to communicate over the barrier of Alzheimer's and the fears and doubts raised by the loss of communication. Also of special note is ''Radiant City,'' Gary Burns and Jim Brown's quasi-documentary study of contemporary suburbia, whose environment is described by one expert as ''brutal, depressing and spiritually degrading.'' This film with a satirical edge interweaves portraits of two families who are neighbors in the same sterile development with scenes of a local production of a show called ''Suburb: The Musical.'' The film brings the angst of Richard Yates's novel ''Revolutionary Road'' into the 21st century. (Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, 212-708-9400, moma.org; $10.) STEPHEN HOLDEN"

"{u'main': u""Findings Plunge Archeology of the Americas Into Turmoil Estimates of first Asian migration are 33,000 years apart. By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   ORONO, Me. FROM the tundra of the Yukon to Brazil and southern Chile, archeologists are digging up tantalizing clues that threaten conventional views about the peopling of the Americas. The mounting evidence, if confirmed, could establish that the first migrants from Asia reached the American continent as early as 45,000 years ago, about 33,000 years earlier than commonly believed.   One scholar described the discoveries, which also have been interpreted to suggest that the early Americans may have arrived in many waves of separate migration, as forcing American archeology to a ''critical turning point.''   The disputed claims and conflicting interpretations have stirred up a tempest in American archeology. Skeptics argue that nothing has yet been produced to prove human habitation took place in America before the accepted date of 12,000 years ago, near the end of the last ice age. Some of those who have discovered the new evidence protest that their work is being unduly criticized and some of their research impeded because it runs against prevailing theory. Signs of Tookmaking    For more than half a century, the earliest date for human occupation in the Americas that archeologists accepted as indisputable was about 11,500 years ago, based on the dating of stone projectile points found throughout South and North America since the 1920's. Archeologists assume that the people who made the points were on the continent at least several hundred years earlier.   But discoveries over the last decade in the Bluefish Caves along the Old Crow River of Canada's Yukon reveal fractured and flaked bones of mammoths, seeming to tell of human butchering and toolmaking 24,000 years ago. Many scientists are also impressed with other sites, in Pennsylvania and in the western United States, where stone tools and other artifacts suggest human presence much earlier than usually believed.   Excavations in South America are producing results even more at odds with traditional thinking. At Monte Verde in Chile, archeologists have found clay-lined hearths, stone tools, bone implements and traces of the foundations for wooden shelters. The artifacts are 13,000 years old, their discoverers maintain, and deeper deposits yield possible human material dated at 33,000 years.   More astonishing, and controversial, are the findings in rock shelters of northeastern Brazil, where French and Brazilian archeologists have discovered elaborate rock paintings as well as human fireplaces, tools and butchered animal bones. Three years ago they reported that they had dated the paintings at more than 12,000 years old and the other artifacts at 32,000 years old. 'Profound Changes' Foreseen    At a conference here this week at the University of Maine, Niede Guidon, an archeologist at the Institute of Advanced Social Science Studies in Paris, startled scientists by reporting new results that she said showed the Brazilian rock shelters were occupied by humans at least as long ago as 45,000 years. The ''quantity, diversity and preservation'' of materials at the sites, she said, should lead to ''profound changes in the knowledge of prehistorical America.''   Reactions at the four-day meeting reflected the scholarly turmoil over the first Americans: who were they, and when did they arrive?   No one is seriously questioning that they came from Siberia across the Bering Straits, when Asia and America were connected there by a land bridge. It is generally assumed that early people could not have reached America across the oceans and that clear evidence of early people in North America was probably lost during glaciation. But the new evidence is winning converts.   ''Frankly, the sites in South America are driving us to a critical turning point in American archeology,'' said Alan L. Bryan, an anthropologist at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, who has found evidence at the Brazilian site persuasive. Limit Termed 'Untenable'    The dating of the first signs of human habitation at 11,500 years is based on stone projectile points, carefully flaked on both sides to form sharp edges and used either as darts or spearheads. They were found in the 1920's near the towns of Folsom and Clovis in New Mexico.   Similar points were soon identified at sites throughout North America, and other stone weapons were discovered as far south as Patagonia. The Clovis people thus came to be thought of as the paleoindians, ancestors of the people encountered by Columbus. 'There Is No Consensus'    A number of influential archeologists are resisting the growing challenge to the Clovis people's primacy. They caution that the sites yielding earlier dates must be examined more carefully to be accepted as genuine pre-Clovis encampments. One particular concern, they say, is the problem of being able to determine if the stone and bone objects, crude by Clovis standards, are actually the work of humans and not the result of natural erosion in streams or landslides.   One of the skeptics, Thomas F. Lynch, a specialist in South American archeology at Cornell University, said: ''I'm still unconvinced. A lot of weak cases don't add up to a strong case.''   David J. Meltzer, an archeologist at Southern Methodist University, summed up the dispute. ''Some say the evidence for earlier Americans is out there plain to see, and the skeptics are blinded by their theories,'' he said. ''One thing we can say, there is no consensus.''   Dr. Guidon is frustrated by the lack of acceptance of her results from the Brazilian rock shelter, known as Pedra Furada. In an interview, she said: ''Why is American archeology so conservative and rigid? Nobody questions dates since 12,000. Why are only the earlier dates considered suspect and bad? It's emotional.'' Harm to Research Seen    The issue of possibly unscientific behavior has indeed been raised. After talking to investigators at some of the disputed sites, Robson Bonnichsen, director of the University of Maine's Center for the Study of the First Americans, said the climate of controversy was ''adversely affecting'' their research.   ''Numerous meritorious grant proposals have been rejected because their goals and objectives were incompatible with entrenched academic opinion,'' he said. ''At least five South American archeologists admitted that they are suppressing pre-12,000-year-old data out of fear that their funds would be cut off by American colleagues who endorse the short-chronology school of thought.'' 'Mind-Boggling' Findings    Like many archeologists who have visited Pedra Furada, Dr. Bonnichsen said Dr. Guidon's findings were ''mind-boggling'' but may turn out to be correct and certainly deserve a respectful hearing. Dr. Guidon complained that her severest skeptics had yet to visit the site.   One of the leading skeptics, Vance Haynes of the University of Arizona in Tucson, said he had not altered his views but declined to make any further comment. In a letter to Dr. Meltzer a few years ago concerning the Monte Verde site, Dr. Haynes proposed that a ''panel of objective conservatives'' could help resolve such disputes by collecting their own samples at the sites for study. ''If a positive consensus results,'' Dr. Haynes wrote, ''we can then accept the interpretation and formulate new hypotheses for peopling the New World.'' Authenticating a Discovery    The task of authenticating an archeological discovery usually begins with geology. The sediments containing the artifacts must be examined to make sure the layers have not been disturbed by stream erosion or other forces and that the bones or tools belong in the sediments.   Another step is to demonstrate beyond doubt that the materials are related to human activity. It was clear that the Folsom and Clovis points were made by human hunters. But other objects identified as scrapers and choppers can be so crude that they could just as easily have been worn or broken by natural forces. Such is the case, some archeologists say, with artifacts at Pedra Furada.   Next, archeologists want to establish a pattern of the artifacts and other aspects of the site. Is it clear what people were doing there? A fair sprinkling of rock or bone flakes would indicate they were making tools and weapons. Animal bones broken in a certain way might indicate a hunting camp.   Finding charcoal in the deposits is critical because it could mean people were cooking and, moreover, it is a key to establishing a date. Wood or bone, anything that once lived, is essential in radiocarbon dating, which measures the time since the material was burned or killed. Widespread Occupation Found    Dr. Guidon, responding to possible objections, said the charcoal at Pedra Furada was concentrated in stone hearths and so was not likely to have come from a forest fire. Also, she said, the rock shelter is high on a cliff, far from trees.   Pedra Furada is situated in an arid wilderness in the Brazilian state of Piaui. Carbon dating and geological analysis, Dr. Guidon said, indicated that the rock shelter was occupied by successive groups of people from as long as 45,000 years to 5,000 years ago. Test digging elsewhere in the valley indicated that human occupation was widespread.   Since the skeptics doubt the evidence of the stone artifacts at Pedra Furada, they have yet to judge the claims under the other criterea.   The rock paintings, which first drew archeologists to the site, were made with red ochre and, Dr. Guidon said, are ''a joyful and free art.'' Some fragments of paint have been found in deposits as old as 17,000 years, which would make the artists contemporaries of the Cro-Magnon people who decorated the caves of France and Spain. Paintings of People    Anne-Marie Pessis, a member of the French-Brazilian team, said the most abundant and most legible paintings were made 12,000 years ago. In contrast to the Cro-Magnon animal and hunting scenes, she said, most Pedra Furada art depicts people in everyday activities. Later, however, the art depicts violent scenes.   If the findings at Pedra Furada and Monte Verde in Chile are confirmed, Dr. Meltzer said, it does not necessarily mean that the earliest people at such sites were the ancestors of today's native Americans. They could have been part of early waves of migration from Asia that eventually failed. Later migrations might have been more successful and out of this ''melting pot'' of people emerged the Clovis people, he said.   A serious gap in the evidence for such an argument, archeologists said, is the absence of established relics from the route of migration closer to the Bering land bridge. Richard E. Morlan of the Archeological Survey of Canada said that, though the bone fragments from Bluefish Caves in the Yukon were dated at 24,000 to 40,000 years old, it was only ''a working hypothesis'' that they were broken by human hunters. If they were, it would be the earliest evidence for human presence in the region.   Tom D. Dillehay, an archeologist at the University of Kentucky in Lexington, who discovered the Monte Verde site, said, ''Logic has always told me something had to be here before Clovis.''""}",,https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/30/science/findings-plunge-archeology-americas-into-turmoil-estimates-first-asian-migration.html,

It's enough to make some Newfoundlanders ponder whether they might have fared better in an economic union with the United States, one of the options they considered before joining confederation with Canada in 1949. Newfoundland had been a British colony until then. When Ottawa's differences with the provinces are mentioned - and that happens often in this regionally divided country - French-speaking Quebec comes first to mind.

It brings the sudden start of a cramped growing season and an almost hectic appreciation of the country's few warmer days.

The writers were going to present Wayne Gretzky with their Sports Professional of the Year award again. ''I'll bet he tells us it means more to him than the Stanley Cup,'' one of the writers said. ''Or the Hart.'' ''Or his contract with General Mills. What do you think that's worth, eh?'' Bill Tuele, director of public relations for the Oilers, joined our table.

The light was red, but there were no cars in sight. No policemen, either. It was a narrow little street. The rain was fairly heavy and unpleasant. But still the small crowd waited patiently - rather stupidly, I thought - until the light changed. I had arrived in Canada, my new home, just that day, and at first I assumed that there must be some kind of police campaign under way - perhaps plainclothes men employed in an anti-jaywalking detail. After almost a year of living north of the border, I have come to realize that no, this is just the way things are in Canada. Authority, rules and proprieties are all hallowed and respected, and that includes traffic lights. Order is accepted as a higher virtue than freedom, security as a greater boon than liberty."
