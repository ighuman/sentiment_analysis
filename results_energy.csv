Petrofund will pay 0.442 unit and 17 Canadian cents for each Ultima unit, the trusts, based in Calgary, Alberta, said in a statement. The acquisition will increase Petrofund's production to the equivalent of 37,133 barrels of oil a day and reduce interest costs, the trusts said. The expanded trust will have net debt of 231.7 million Canadian dollars. ''The larger size will improve Petrofund's financing ability and its ability to compete for future acquisitions,'' Chris Dutcher, Petrofund's director of business development, said. The acquisition would also help Petrofund comply with a provision of the federal budget proposed by the Canadian government last week that would limit foreign ownership of oil and gas trusts to about 49 percent, beginning in 2007, Mr. Dutcher said. About 66 percent of the units of Petrofund, which was created in 1988, are held by foreign investors, he said."

The accident in Pickering, Ontario, never threatened public safety, but it forced a costly shutdown of the power plant and increased criticism of the Government's interest in exporting the reactors to sustain Canada's nuclear industry, which has 35,000 workers. ''The most likely casualty from the accident will be the Government's efforts to export these reactors,'' said Norman Rubin, a spokesman for Energy Probe, a Toronto-based citizens action group that monitors and comments on Government energy policies and programs. The group contends that in its zeal to sell the reactors, the Government has been concentrating on developing countries that are unlikely or unable to apply full safeguards. In general, the group would like the Government to follow the lead of major private companies in the United States that are phasing out reactor construction while stressing projects in nuclear waste conversion and disposal."

But no concessions were made to American and other foreign companies that have complained both of discriminatory treatment and of a federal ''grab'' of their potential earnings. Energy Minister Marc Lalonde, reacting to universal complaints from oil and gas companies of drastically reduced cash flows since the National Energy Program was introduced in October l980, declared in a House of Commons speech that the plan ''is working on all fronts and will continue to work.''"

Officials said on Friday that the 700,000-kilowatt power plant, estimated to cost about $1 billion, would be built in Wolsong, 160 miles southeast of Seoul. It will be built next to the first Canadian reactor, which has been operating since 1983. South Korea and Canada are each other's fifth-largest trading partners. Trade between the companies is expected to reach $4 billion in 1990. The Korean power company, known as Kepco, has nine nuclear power plants in operation and two more under construction. The Government expects to have 50 nuclear plants in operation in the next 40 years.

"{u'main': u""HNG WRITE-OFF SET ON PERU OIL ASSETS CHICAGO, Dec. 30 - HNG/Internorth Inc. said today that it expected to take a large write-off because of the nationalization of its Belco Petroleum operations in Peru.   The Belco unit was seized last Saturday after the company and the Peruvian Government failed to reach an agreement on exploration spending and a tax rate. Another threatened company, Occidental Petroleum, worked out a new contract with Peru, agreeing to expand exploration in return for additional acreage.   On Aug. 29, just after its contract with Peru expired, Belco is said to have cut its production to about 20,000 barrels a day from 30,000 barrels.   Although Belco's operations in Peru have a book value of $400 million, industry analysts said the parent corporation was expected to take a substantially smaller charge.   ''They're going to take a loss of somewhere between $100 million and $200 million,'' said David N. Fleischer, a vice president with Prudential-Bache Securities. Mr. Fleischer and other analysts based their estimates on the company's liabilities after taxes, the expectation of a settlement with the Peruvian Government and proceeds from insurance.   HNG/Internorth, which is based in Omaha, has assets of $10.5 billion, and it earned $165.2 million for the first nine months of 1985 on revenues of $8.02 billion. In the first quarter, HNG earned $113.8 million on $2.90 billion in revenues, of which the Belco unit contributed $19.9 million in earnings, deriving about 24 percent of that from its Peruvian operations. HNG did not report Belco's earnings separately in the second and third quarters.   Both the Standard & Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investment Service affirmed Internorth's ratings today. S.&P. said that its ratings covered $1.9 billion of debt and that the company's senior debt holds a BBB rating. Moody's pointed out that although the exact financial effect of Peru's move was uncertain, some compensation from the Latin American nation was expected.   Separately, HNG/InterNorth said it was withdrawing a proposed offering of 9 3/4 percent notes due in 1992. It said the takeover of Belco's Peruvian operations made it impractical to close the offering today as scheduled.   Belco, which has energy operations in the United States and Canada, is reportedly discussing new exploration with the Governments of Ecuador, Indonesia and Australia.""}",,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/31/business/hng-write-off-set-peru-oil-assets-chicago-dec-30-hng-internorth-said-today-that.html,

Under this policy, Canadian-owned concerns are given tax and exploration incentives that are not available to foreign-owned companies. As a result, a number of United States companies have sold their Canadian energy holdings in recent months, including Conoco Inc., the St. Joe Minerals Corporation and the Allied Corporation."

Compared to the United States, Canada's bad news is worse; inflation is nearly double the American rate, unemployment is one-fifth higher and interest rates are steeper. Explanations are many. It is common wisdom that interest rates must be higher in Canada than in the United States if investment is not to flow southward. Canadian labor costs are comparatively high and as a supplier of resources, Canada is vulnerable to global economic downturns. Then there is the argument, pressed by the Reagan Administration, that Canada has shot itself in the financial foot by imposing nationalistic measures. Critics - including Gulf Oil, which last week cited the plan as a principal culprit in laying off 300 workers - have suggested that the two-year-old National Energy Program has added to inflation, stimulated interest rates and helped bankrupt small oil companies and their suppliers."

Energy Minister Jean Chretien told reporters Monday that a scheduled price increase of $4 a barrel on July 1, which would apply to more than three-quarters of the oil produced in Canada, would not take place. That increase was mandated by a formula reached by Ottawa and the province of Alberta on Sept.1, 1981. However, another feature of that agreement limited oil prices to 75 percent of the world oil price. Currently, the price for ''old'' oil - discovered before Dec. 31, 1980 - is about 73 percent of the free market price for the previous quarter, the period used to make the calculation. A $4 increase would have pushed the price to about 84 percent of the world level."

To plumb it, the Mobil Oil Corporation and its partners must contend with lashing winds, 100-foot waves and ice chunks of a magnitude that sank the Titanic a few miles away. That sort of task is expensive -these days, maybe too expensive. The Mobil group must raise $5 billion to produce oil from the alley that will sell for half the price of five years ago. And now there is a real question as to whether it is worth proceeding. That question is being raised about countless high-cost energy megaprojects throughout this oil-rich country. In the last 10 years Canada has spent billions to recover hard-to-get-at oil, gambling that crude prices would keep going up. But now the dramatic price slides engineered by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries have turned the economics of Canadian oil development on its ear. Oil companies here are looking askance at projects that once seemed destined for financial greatness, and may drop some if oil prices do not pick up."

To succeed, he will need unaccustomed cooperation from skeptical Canadians. He seems confident of getting it: When a reporter asked if he had perhaps lost political effectiveness after more than 13 years as Prime Minister, Mr. Trudeau replied coldly, ''No, I haven't given that any thought.'' Others have. The recession, with high inflation, high interest rates and unemployment above 10 percent, has spread fear and unrest among wage-earners, farmers, and small businessmen. But even before the situation became critical, something verging on Trudeauphobia began to replace the Trudeaumania that swept the French Quebecer into office in 1968 and (with only a brief interruption in 1979) has kept him there. The Globe and Mail of Toronto seemed to be speaking for many of Canada's decision-makers when it said, ''Recovery has no chance if Mr. Trudeau stays.'' It added, ''If we are to acquire faith in our potential for recovery, we must have a sign of change more believable than any budget could provide. Such a sign can come only from Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, and it can come only with his resignation. His real failings are many. He can no longer deal with our problem. He is our problem.''"

''At least once a year, Canada comes together in the spirit of friendly competition, not vitriolic competition,'' Jake Gaudaur, commissioner of the Canadian Football League, said. Added Abraham Rotstein, a political economist at the University of Toronto, ''It represents a gut nationalism, a national binder of an extraordinary kind.'' It all comes together in the fight for the Grey Cup, an unimpressive but coveted silver mug, in a game that to more modest Canadians substitutes for the glossy grandeur of America's Super Bowl. Sunday's game will pit the hometown Toronto Argonauts, champions of the east, against the Edmonton Eskimos, champions of the west."

Its derrick stands as tall as a 35-story building over the water, 14,400 horsepower of machinery pounds relentlessly and 81 crew members scurry about a surface area bigger than two football fields. ''The massiveness kind of terrifies you at first,'' William Aitkenhead, the Ranger's captain, noted later. That is indisputable.

In New York's foreign-exchange trading, the Canadian dollar dropped last Thursday to 82 United States cents before closing at 82.156 cents, down from the previous day's 82.21 cents. Shortly after it hit the 82-cent level, the Bank of Canada moved to defend the nation's currency by raising its discount rate, a key interest rate, to 19.89 percent from 19.04 percent, the biggest jump in two months. After the central bank's action, the Canadian dollar recovered somewhat on Friday, closing at 82.24 United States cents."

That somewhat distant corporate kinship was recalled last week when the firms announced that A.E. Ames & Company Ltd. would merge with Dominion Securities, creating the largest brokerage house in Canada. The decision to join forces, officials of the two brokerages explained, resulted from the need for access to a substantial amount of capital to handle the increasingly large-scale underwriting projects here, especially in energy-related areas. Anthony S. Fell, president and chief executive officer of Dominion Securities who will have the same positions with the merged firm, Dominion Securities Ames Ltd., said on Monday that in terms of capitalization the new firm would rank No.1 in Canada, ''about 20 percent bigger than Wood Gundy Ltd.''
