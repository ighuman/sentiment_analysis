Studies of scat of moose, caribou and wolves in the area showed that caribou accounted for only 10 percent of the animals consumed by wolves. Eighty percent of the wolves' diet was deer, with moose making up the remainder. Wolves' preference for deer, the researchers conclude, draws them away from the areas where caribou thrive."

As farfetched as that question at first may seem, both Canadian and American scientists say the concern is warranted, for though it would produce virtually pollution-free energy, the environmental costs of harnessing the Fundy tides of more than 50 feet may be too high. Most of those costs, due to the effects of a Fundy dam on tides in the Gulf of Maine, would be borne not by Canada, but by the United States, and would range from the flooding of valuable New England beachfront property to damage to coastal anadromous fish stocks, especially the herrings, most especially the American shad. While fishermen in the Northeast are just looking forward to the spring shad-spawning runs in the Delaware, Hudson, and Connecticut Rivers, in southern rivers the shad season has been under way since mid-February. In the St. John's in Florida, the Altemaha in Georgia, Albemarle Sound to Virginia's Rappahannock and Potomac, the traditional shad fisheries are commercial fisheries. There, gill nets take the large silver-sided herrings; most of the fish is sold for its roe."

The two sides agreed to name a joint committee of experts. They will review a long-proposed land reclamation and irrigation project for which ground has been broken in North Dakota. The project for the diversion of the Garrison River has passionate adherents in North Dakota and equally passionate opponents in Canada. It is but one of several dozen environmental issues that straddle the remarkably open and porous frontier between the United States and Canada that stretches 3,987 miles from New Brunswick to Vancouver, plus the 1,538 miles separating Alaska from the Yukon and Northwest Territories. It is the longest unfortified border in the world. Enormous amounts of people, ideas, goods, money, fads, energy, water, animals and pollution shuttle back and forth with little bureaucratic interference. But precisely because the two countries and cultures are so integrated, events on one side of the border are likely to set off ripples or shock waves on the other. As in the case of the Manitoba- North Dakota controversy, the debate over acid rain or the unsuccessful attempts to obtain fishing treaties covering Atlantic and Pacific species, these issues often require arduous and time-consuming adjustments of clashing sovereign interests."

Its derrick stands as tall as a 35-story building over the water, 14,400 horsepower of machinery pounds relentlessly and 81 crew members scurry about a surface area bigger than two football fields.

Eastern Europeans consider smoking an inalienable right; Parisian restaurateurs shrug as patrons puff away in areas designated no smoking; Italian efforts are focused on establishments that cater to Americans. Restrictions abroad in movie theaters and lobbies, on trains, planes and buses, vary widely. It can be a shock to American travelers to find that in Tokyo restaurants are cloaked in a tobacco haze (but commuter trains and subways are smoke-free) just as foreign travelers may be confounded by no-smoking rules in New York City. In South America and Mexico, smoke is still savored, but in Canada, opponents of smoking are pushing hard to clear the air. What follows are reports on where in the world people smoke, and where they don't. Toronto, Vancouver and other Canadian cities are gradually moving to make it virtually impossible to smoke in indoor public places. ''I think public opinion is ahead of us on this one,'' says Dr. David McKeown, Toronto's acting medical officer of health. ''It's a health issue, not a rights issue.'' He cited a recent survey of 3,200 Torontonians by the polling group Angus Reid that found 65 percent want to make all public places smoke-free immediately."

But now the dramatic price slides engineered by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries have turned the economics of Canadian oil development on its ear. Oil companies here are looking askance at projects that once seemed destined for financial greatness, and may drop some if oil prices do not pick up."
