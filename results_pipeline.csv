An excavator working on a sewer line on Tuesday broke the pipeline, sending a plume of crude oil about 60 to 100 feet into the air until the system was shut down 25 minutes later. Eight homes in Burnaby were heavily coated by the oil and remained evacuated. Several oil-saturated streets remained closed. Storm sewers caused some oil to enter Burrard Inlet, although light winds and the rapid placement of containment barriers limited its spread. The Canadian Transportation Safety Board is investigating. The pipeline is owned by Kinder Morgan Energy Partners of Houston."

More unusual still, McNall and Gretzky brought Ismail in as a future partner.

Now, the unusual combination of owner and player not only signed the slithery wide-receiver, kick-return star, they have showered him with the biggest deal ever accorded a rookie football player: a four-year contract that will guarantee him at least $14 million, including a $4 million bonus to sign. The complete details of the package, which could ultimately be worth more than $26 million, have not been released. A Share of the Team In addition, Ismail will eventually own about 6 percent of the Toronto Argonauts. McNall, who owns 60 percent of the team, has agreed to give Ismail 10 percent of his share when the player retires. Gretzky owns 20 percent and John Candy, a Canadian-born comic actor, also owns 20 percent.

To plumb it, the Mobil Oil Corporation and its partners must contend with lashing winds, 100-foot waves and ice chunks of a magnitude that sank the Titanic a few miles away. That sort of task is expensive -these days, maybe too expensive. The Mobil group must raise $5 billion to produce oil from the alley that will sell for half the price of five years ago. And now there is a real question as to whether it is worth proceeding. That question is being raised about countless high-cost energy megaprojects throughout this oil-rich country. In the last 10 years Canada has spent billions to recover hard-to-get-at oil, gambling that crude prices would keep going up.
